** Fixing =yasnippet= conflict

Pressing tab with company mode conflicts with =yasnippets=, this is
the only fix that I found that makes everything work as expected.

          (backward-char 1)
          (if (looking-at "->") t nil)))))

    (let ((yas/fallback-behavior 'return-nil))
      (yas/expand)))
